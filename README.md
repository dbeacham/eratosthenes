# Etymology

There are three complementary reasons for choosing the name Eratosthenes.

1.  To remind my dad that cheats never prosper after stealing my answer to this

    > So earnest, the silly old astronomer (12) [Times Jumbo 396, March 30
    > 2002]

    and attempting to take full credit for it.

2.  There's a certain resemblance between Eratosthenes and my dad.
